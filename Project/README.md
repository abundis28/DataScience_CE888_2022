# DataScience_CE888_2022/Project: Inexperienced Queries

### Project description:
This project intends to explores/improve the translation of natural language questions that look for a numeric answer (min, max, mean, etc...) into SQL queries.

### Repository description:
Up to now, the repository only includes the Jupyter notebook for data analysis and pre-processing. The dataset was not included to avoid intellectual property issues and to avoid uploading/downloading big amounts of information. The next section describes how the dataset can be downloaded from the Spider project website.

### Instructions to download the Spider dataset:
Link: https://yale-lily.github.io/spider <br>
Please click on the link above and the button to initiate the download of the zip folder is on the left lower side (probably will have to scroll a little bit) labeled as "Spider Dataset" in the section "Getting Started". Please extract the train_spider.json file (can extract all the contents but only the JSON file is needed for the Jupyter notebook) into a meaningful location in your documents and copy the absolute filepath.

### Instructions to run/use code:
Paste the copied filepath in the first parameter of the open() function that is also inside of the read_json() function in the second python code cell. You are set and can run the whole notebook!
